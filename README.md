# Exploratory Analysis of RAPTOR Metrics in the Modern NBA

## Project Overview
RAPTOR (Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings) is a modern-day plus-minus statistical analysis developed by FiveThirtyEight. This system measures the number of points a player contributes to his team’s offense/defense per 100 possessions, relative to a league-average player. Our team will be analyzing the `latest_RAPTOR_by_team.csv` (play-by-play metrics from the 2022-2023 NBA season) and the approximate `historical_RAPTOR_by_team.csv` charts (predictive analyses dating from 1977-2022) to analyze comparisons between both sets of data across a variety of criteria. 

## Installation and Usage Instructions of Libraries/Tools
We are utilizing two datasets within FiveThirtyEight's RAPTOR database:

- [Latest RAPTOR Analytics by Team](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-model/2023/latest_RAPTOR_by_team.csv) 
- [Historical RAPTOR Analytics by Team](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/nba-raptor/historical_RAPTOR_by_team.csv) 

## Intro

## Project Goals
- Does the amount of possessions per player greatly impact that player’s overall RAPTOR ratings? Why or why not?
- Which team displayed the highest/lowest RAPTOR ratings across the 2022-23 season across all players? How does this data compare to their predictive PREDATOR model?
- How accurate are the overall results of predictive-RAPTOR, which was used for the historical data charts (1977-2013), compared to those of modern - RAPTOR’s integration (2013-Present)? 
- In what ways does the RAPTOR model accurately showcase a team’s Win/Loss ratio? In what ways does it not?
- How do these statistics line up by player in relation to the top players/teams (MVPs) of the 2022-2023 season?
